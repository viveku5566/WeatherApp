## üß± Architecture

This app follows a scalable and modular architecture using **Redux Toolkit**:

/src
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/               # Redux store configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/            # App logos, splash images, etc.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/        # Reusable UI components (SearchBar, ForecastCards, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ features/weather/  # Redux slice and async thunks for weather
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/             # Typed Redux hooks (useAppDispatch, useAppSelector)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ screens/           # Page-level views (HomeScreen, SplashScreen)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/          # API logic using Axios
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles/            # Centralized styled-components definitions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/             # TypeScript interfaces and global types
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/             # Utility helpers (debounce.ts, network.ts)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __tests__/         # All Jest unit test files
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/    # Component-specific tests (e.g., SearchBar.test.tsx)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ screens/       # Screen-level tests (e.g., HomeScreen.test.tsx)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ features/      # Slice/thunk unit tests
